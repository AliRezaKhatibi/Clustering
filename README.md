# Clustering
Using Kmeans and Kneighbors algorithm for clustering Iris and Mall data

In the Mall_Customers dataset 
KMeans algorithm has been used for clustering by selecting the most optimal features
Code : https://github.com/AliRezaKhatibi/Clustering/blob/37f78016330668536b4cb6898731a9575316a0be/README.md

In the iris dataset 
From Neighbors algorithm in the direction of clustering by choosing the most optimal features in order to classify this plant into three categories:
Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica have been used.
And finally, a prediction model has been built by giving four characteristics:
SepalLengthCm, 
SepalWidthCm,
PetalLengthCm,
PetalWidthCm,
It is possible to determine the type of plant with good accuracy.
